<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. La Simbiosis entre Colonialismo y Capitalismo.</h2><p class="descripcion">El colonialismo y el capitalismo son frecuentemente señalados como sistemas interdependientes, donde uno expande y refuerza al otro, generando explotación y desigualdad a escala global.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Capitalism and colonialism are and always have been pretty brutal… ya ding dong.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is an oppressive system that is used to expand the system of capitalism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Capitalism and colonialism have always gone hand-in-hand. You don’t defeat one without the other because it’s all about power and a greed mindset.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Yikes. Colonialism and capitalism are the same thing, seen from different perspectives in time.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is served by capitalism and vice versa. We need to speak while we still can.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism itself is used to expand and produce more capital. Capitalism needs to sustain itself through fascism, colonialism, and imperialism. This literally colonialism happening before our gaze.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Capitalism and colonialism are violent fantasies there are forced upon us. The consequences are real.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Capitalism and colonialism go together like cops and doughnuts. Especially since a lot of colonialism was driven by companies.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">From day one. Capitalism and colonialism go hand in hand. Everything we have was built on the backs of genocide and ethnic cleansing.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism, capitalism. They're both structures that run on human trafficking , and incentivize poverty to justify exploitation.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is served by capitalism and vice versa. We need to speak while we still can.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Remember that most of the shit going wrong on this planet can be traced back to colonialism and capitalism.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. El Legado del Colonialismo y su Impacto Continuo.</h2><p class="descripcion">El colonialismo no es solo un evento histórico, sino un sistema que continúa manifestándose en diversas formas, perpetuando la explotación y la desigualdad en el mundo actual.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never ended. We're witnessing colonialist &amp; capitalist actors working together to seize lands from indigenous nations, to decimate and exploit the earth in the name of profit, and to turn us against each other so we don't come after them.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism has been the curse of this world and it continues through other names now.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Pretty much the whole of western civilization is built on colonialism. It's all fucked from the start. There's no getting rid of the rot. Looks like payment is due for all of it now.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never ended, it's just more "economic" now. Imf and world bank. Ugh. They push neoliberalism "shock treatment", extreme free markets on countries as a condition of loans. When successful there are more billionaires, and way more homeless and shanty town dwellers.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism isn't something that 'happened in the past'. European colonizers designed a system that continues to starve the global south, serving imperialist greed and leaving a legacy of malnutrition, inequality and cultural erasure.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never truly went away. It just changed form. No need to invade and occupy, just help prop up corrupt local politicians, give them shitloads of money, and let the common people be exploited and suffer for cheap resources you get to import on the dollar.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is like a cult. They get you so invested that you think all their crazy practices are normal. But life under colonial capitalism is sick and depraved. If "society" is supposed to be about collective care and the betterment of the human race, then western civilization is not society.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism has been the primary driver of death and destruction on this planet for centuries.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is alive and thriving across the globe because racism and greed hasn't died!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The residue of colonialism has done a lot of bad things for the global south. And here they are bringing it home. We have everything it would take to make the whole world prosperous and it is just wasted.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never ended;t just changednames.owerful nations and corporations still exploit resources,erase cultures,and profit from marginalized communities.thiscycleof oppression must be acknowledged and resisted.true justicemeans restoring dignity, land, and autonomy to those whohave been wronged.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism returned to the western people. It's difficult to find words cynical enough to describe it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is still a norm globally. That's the problem. We can't just say certain things are good enough then move on. We need to be advocating and striving for proper decolonization.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is not only a physical manifestation of power imbalances and oppression through military and economic means. It is also a mental manifestation from the oppressors to the oppressed to keep them compliant with their own oppression. As such, we must all types of colonialism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism casts a long shadow, and it leaves countries in turmoil.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never ended. It’s evolved and adapted, but it most definitely has not ended.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Man, the whip of colonialism hits back hard. This whiplash has been a long time coming.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The day of colonialism is followed by the day of rampant capitalism. I find that kinda funny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism isn’t good for anyone. We need to remember this.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism and neo-liberalism are built on resource extraction and slavery; both of indigenous peoples and the working class. Every country is blighted by these twin evils. Together we can build a just world.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is our failure to face the worst of, and to deny the best of, our possibilities.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is not only a physical manifestation of power imbalances and oppression through military and economic means. It is also a mental manifestation from the oppressors to the oppressed to keep them compliant with their own oppression. As such, we must all types of colonialism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism come home.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never died, the colonialists' "changed uniforms" &amp; now wear foreign government &amp; corporate suits at the core of the suffering of ordinary peoples of the world are dangerous/thieving/obscenely wealthy/ greed-infested/selfish/arrognant foreign colonialists.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism has always been a bad thing. And it never ended.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is still a norm globally. That's the problem. We can't just say certain things are good enough then move on. We need to be advocating and striving for proper decolonization.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism turned out to be bad not because of the violent, racist ideology that fueled it but because generally all humans are bad. As a lesson, instead of the need to confront and root out western chauvinism, i'd recommend embedding stronger social controls. I'll be taking no further questions.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism has been the primary driver of death and destruction on this planet for centuries.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism and capitalism have lied to us about our power and what matters. You have given me the opportunity to articulate things i might not have otherwise. For all we know this conversation is giving someone else a useful idea.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is alive and thriving across the globe because racism and greed hasn't died!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism. Even your friends, the absolute monarchies, have decided it's better to work with colonial powers rather than oppose them. Neocolonialism and capitalism is the superstructure that underpins everything.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Capitalist colonialism invents whole societies to keep on the backburner to invade later if need be.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The problem with neo-colonialism is that it is not sufficiently based if you don't die in a pointless forever war making some random capitalist richer.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Everything is colonialism. Good things are actually bad if a western nation is involved. The only acceptable way for atrocities in the global south to be requited is if the local population rises up and does it themselves, which will happen any day now. I am very intelligent.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It excuses colonialism by conflating it with the typical conquest of land mentality that has existed for millennia, when it is instead a uniquely harmful facet of capitalism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never truly went away. It just changed form. No need to invade and occupy, just help prop up corrupt local politicians, give them shitloads of money, and let the common people be exploited and suffer for cheap resources you get to import on the dollar.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is against humanity. The only interests served are those who sit at the top of the hierarchy. This drive runs centuries deep in global minority cultures. We must offer radical resistance to see radical change, call out colonialism wherever &amp; whenever we see it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is still very much alive (that was the theme of my master’s research). If we consider ourselves progressive, leftist, the first fight we have to fight is against the colonialist and the fascist within ourselves in our daily lives.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism was always about resource extraction and shatting domestic industry to create markets for western industry. There's a reason the us backed these guys.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">That's how colonialism always worked. The problem today is now it's working against yourselves. The greed of colonization will always catch up to the colonizer.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Why the world sucks, colonialism that's the only reason capitalism is just another form of that.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It is the same everywhere. Colonialism isn’t good for anyone. We need to remember this.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Don't forget colonialism, which stretches its dirty tentacles everywhere even now.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism and capitalist economics have ensured that certain ppl remain rich and others remain poor.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">In the following weeks, we are taking a deep dive into the harms of colonialism in our posts. Colonization (past and present) is a large, complex system that maintains other oppressive systems within it: racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, ableism, etc.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It is materially inevitable in order to keep up social order if your social order you want to keep up is capitalism. This isn't a coincidence or even a project. Eventually, colonialism turns inward as capitalism decays. Our failure to stop mass death in the imperial periphery is about to come back.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It’s colonialism and until people decolonize their minds, see the system for what it is, we will see our descendants facing the same challenges 60 years from now.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The present only makes sense if we understand that colonialism and capitalism are intertwined, meaning we are still in the middle to late colonial era, not beyond it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is when you ban a poisonous industrial chemical, but you settle with the companies by subsidizing the export of those chemicals to the countries who have no other choice. This is violence. There are murders here. Where is this vaunted western justice?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is not a thing of the past. . Is still ok with it as long as it's them or an ally doing it. I am ashamed of my government.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">(and i think that has profound political implications and effects in response to capitalism and colonialism).</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I think the new colonialism is economic. I don't support it, but we're headed in that direction of not already there.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is alive and well. I am always playing a game of which business/lawyer politician is going to do the least harm. Unfortunately it feels like the bar is constantly lowering.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Third, your phrase “anti-neoliberal colonial” is laughable. It doesn’t mean anything. You’re trying to say i oppose neoliberalism while ignoring colonialism? no. I reject both. They are not separable systems.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism was deeply profitable. If you don't disagree on principle then you are conceding to their principles.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sadly, colonialism is still the mindset of certain people in leadership positions.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Imperialism / colonialism is the final face of capitalism. What's being done to palestine, congo, sudan and the elsewhere in the resource rich global south is just a preview of what will happen to places that thought themselves exempt.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism no longer exists. That framework ended middle of last century when all the remaining colonized countries (mostly in africa) won their freedom.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism doesn't help the citizens. The loot just becomes a higher level of resources to oppress their own people with. That's been true of all empires. Without their public foundation, it causes the whole thing to collapse! oligarchs are always traitors.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Every single person who lives in a country that thrives on colonialism is living beyond their means, no matter how poor we are as individuals if our systems rely on slavery and theft of resources, we are living beyond our means.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Absolutely and probably why they're working so hard to erase our history. Colonialism isn't a good look and we wore it for quite a long time and in a lot of ways unrelated to tfg, still do.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism cannot be satisfied the rich cannot be satisfied which is to say greed cannot be satisfied we must build a society which protects us from the insatiable appetite of greed.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism and imperialism started because rich guys want people's minerals and precious resources. Everything about this deal is gross.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">What’s most interesting to me is entering the era of colonialism with a face. With a face so loud, obnoxious and narcissistic that the absolutely normal way of things, the west inflicting crippling extractive capitalism on vulnerable nations, no one can help but notice it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"beyond this problem of unearned wealth, our report delves deeply into a painful history of colonialism, that casts a long shadow that continues to rupture our world. We know that colonialism benefited the rich countries of the global north, over the global south.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Many of the modern oppression is based on two things: 1. Colonialism 2. Capitalism to end oppression, we have to end these two!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">They dgaf if you have food or healthcare if you are poor. Don’t be surprised they dgaf about famine/genocide. Capitalism/colonialism is a dysfunctional human behavior. We are strongest when we collaborate. Humanity needs to eliminate toxic capitalism mindset/behavior before we go extinct.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">“capitalist development is sustained by manufacturing unsustainable aspirations, perpetuating false notions of progress…&amp; spreading misinformation through mainstream media. This fuels a form of colonialism over our minds &amp; bodies…” - .</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never truly went away. It just changed form. No need to invade and occupy, just help prop up corrupt local politicians, give them shitloads of money, and let the common people be exploited and suffer for cheap resources you get to import on the dollar.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I read something recently which stated that it's not humans which are the problem. It's capitalism and colonialism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"processes long directed outward—through colonialism and imperialism—are turning inward in ways that undermine capitalist laws of motion and repeat accumulation strategies typical of feudalism: rent-seeking, plunder, and political control." – jodi dean.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never ended, didn't you get the memo? it's the reason the brics nations and others are planning to drop the dollar and move to a multipolar economic system.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is still very much alive (that was the theme of my master’s research). If we consider ourselves progressive, leftist, the first fight we have to fight is against the colonialist and the fascist within ourselves in our daily lives.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Start with a continent with extraordinary natural resources. Add greedy imperialists, stir in corporate colonialism. Add slavery. Stir. Watch as classes distribute wealth by abusing humans and the environment. Observe the rise and re-rise of robber barony. Corp. Colonialists take gov't. Clearer now?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The day of colonialism is followed by the day of rampant capitalism. I find that kinda funny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">That's how colonialism always worked. The problem today is now it's working against yourselves.

Colonialism isn’t good for anyone. We need to remember this.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Don't forget colonialism, which stretches its dirty tentacles everywhere even now.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Capitalism and colonialism is a tie that white men have put around the necks of others, calling us savages, whores, and uncivilized. They use terms like "healthcare" for companies that turn a profit on denying medicine. Which we can only access with the expectation that we work.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Yep. And especially here in the west, where we not only exploit our most vulnerable, we exploit the fuck out of the rest of the world. Colonialism never ended. We just don’t call it that anymore.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism and neo-liberalism are built on resource extraction and slavery; both of indigenous peoples and the working class. Every country is blighted by these twin evils. Together we can build a just world.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is our failure to face the worst of, and to deny the best of, our possibilities.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is not only a physical manifestation of power imbalances and oppression through military and economic means. It is also a mental manifestation from the oppressors to the oppressed to keep them compliant with their own oppression. As such, we must all types of colonialism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Capitalism is so blatantly the root of everything wrong with this country, before and after nominal independence of 26 of 32 counties. With a few centuries of pre-capitalist colonialism in there too.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">She’s right. Is suffering. Colonialism casts a long shadow, and it leaves countries in turmoil.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Also a major factor in why what's happening now is happening. Colonialism come home.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Damn it’s almost like european colonialism &amp; the imperialist systems then built on top of it are the sources for much of the world’s current suffering &amp; injustice.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is always means testing society's tolerance and capacity for socio political regression. Wealth hoarding too is a constant challenge of moral compass.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Hey, that's not fair, it also exports corporate neocolonialism, financial exploitation through debt trap loans to developing countries and just regular old fashioned colonialism too.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never died, the colonialists' "changed uniforms" &amp; now wear foreign government &amp; corporate suits at the core of the suffering of ordinary peoples of the world are dangerous/thieving/obscenely wealthy/ greed-infested/selfish/arrognant foreign colonialists.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Yes to this!! ps it was enough for many of us that colonialism happened (and continues).</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism is still a norm globally. That's the problem. We can't just say certain things are good enough then move on. We need to be advocating and striving for proper decolonization.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">We must end these systems that use our needs, our desires, our compassion as perverse threats. It casts us as soldiers in wars against each other for billionaire profit. Colonialism lies that we, and all beings on this planet, are only objects that capitalists put a price on.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">No, it's really overwhelming on the side of capitalism. Colonialism and imperialism are soaked in blood.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Honestly feel that colonialism is basically the crux of so many of the problems i have with humankind (both globally and nationally, but also just in general). Like thinking about the history and culture and lives lost to years of colonial violence is so deeply sad and immensely frustrating.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Definitely. Colonialism is a murderous system, and all that gold in bruges sits atop a veritable mountain of corpses. As do we all, alas. Genocide is a logical activity of capitalism, from the east india company to today.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism never truly went away. It just changed form. No need to invade and occupy, just help prop up corrupt local politicians, give them shitloads of money, and let the common people be exploited and suffer for cheap resources you get to import on the dollar.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I read something recently which stated that it's not humans which are the problem.
