<h1>13. Patriarcado: La arquitectura del abuso y la violencia sexual</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. The Foundation of Patriarchy: Violence and Rape.</h2><p class="descripcion">This section highlights the core argument that patriarchy is not merely a system that tolerates violence, but one that requires it for its very existence. Rape, wife-beating, and the constant terror of women and children are presented as essential components, not byproducts, of male authority.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The essential element of patriarchy is rape. If women aren’t in constant blind terror of men’s violence, we won’t accept life doing all the shit work for loser vicious men. Patriarchyisabuse.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Patriarchy requires rape and wife-beating. Male authority cannot survive in a world where women are safe from men. Patriarchyisabuse.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Patriarchy cannot exist without rape and wife-beating. If women feel safe and confident, males cannot rule over us. Males depend on women being in a states of constant terror. Patriarchyisabuse.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">People see intimate or sexual violence and say “this is because of patriarchy” when they should be saying “this is patriarchy”.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Intimate and sexual violence are not symptoms of patriarchy they are central components of its structure.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. Rape Culture and Victim Blaming as Tools of Control.</h2><p class="descripcion">These posts describe how societal norms that question, blame, or disbelieve victims of sexual assault serve to reinforce patriarchal structures. Rape culture is identified as an inherent feature of patriarchy, designed to justify predatory behavior and place the burden of proof on survivors.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Victim blaming is a tool of patriarchy. Blaming women for their assaults, rapes, deaths and other oppression promotes more oppression and justifies predators in their attacks on us.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Patriarchy has always been a rape culture. It’s not that they don’t care. It’s what they want.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The fact that rape is a thing that happens, a thing that is tolerated, is proof our society is a patriarchy. Because the root cause of rape is misogyny, and the root cause of misogyny is patriarchy.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">When a man harms a woman, patriarchy trains us to question her story, as if no *individual man* could be guilty. And yet, women are warned from a young age to protect ourselves from exactly this behaviour.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. The System's Protection of Abusers.</h2><p class="descripcion">This theme focuses on how institutions, particularly the justice system, are structured to protect male perpetrators rather than victims. The posts argue that this protection is by design, ensuring that men in power can act with impunity and maintain control.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Patriarchy truly is a cultural force that just protects rapists.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It’s a patriarchy. Men protect men, while denying their role in rape culture.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Yes—this is patriarchy at work. Not just in word, but in policy. The system protects predators by design— defunds care, enables violence, silences survivors. Because in patriarchy, control is sacred. And women's safety is expendable.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The patriarchy don’t like one of their own being jailed for rape.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Victims of sa have had historically to watch their abuser thrive under patriarchy. It’s appalling. Men will say they don’t support men who sa, this has always been untrue.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. Patriarchy as a Mechanism of Control and Oppression.</h2><p class="descripcion">This section explores the view that patriarchy is fundamentally about control over women, children, and anyone who defies gender norms. Violence and the threat of it are the primary means used to enforce this control, deny agency, and maintain a rigid social hierarchy.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Patriarchy is a rigid gender hierarchy where men outrank women who outrank children and faggots/dykes (all those who don't conform to their assigned gender roles). It's very normal for those above to rape those below in order to exert power.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The thing about patriarchy is that it requires violence to maintain its control. And that violence is often sexual.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It's never about protecting the female victim's the patriarchy is in every nation around the world it's about controlling, access and denying women rights it's about abuse and denying women our agency.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The ostensible deal of the patriarchy is "yes the man is abusive but he will protect you from even worse abusers if you let him abuse you." it's a lie. Abusers are cowards and will roll over when a bigger bastard comes by.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Rape is the essential sacrament of patriarchy. Patriarchy requies that all women live in constant suffocating terror of all males because a confident woman can reject a male she doesn’t like. Patriarchyisabuse .</span></li></ul></div></div>
