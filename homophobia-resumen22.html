<h1>22. Charlie Kirk: Un Legado de Racismo, Sexismo y Homofobia</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. Acusaciones de Racismo y Supremacía Blanca.</h2><p class="descripcion">Los textos denuncian de manera recurrente que Charlie Kirk promovió activamente el racismo y la supremacía blanca, considerándolo un pilar central de su discurso público.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Charlie kirk promoted racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia. Kirk had every right to express his political views, and his death is an outrage. But no one who believes in peace and love should praise what he was doing to our politics.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Charlie kirk was an odious bigot, who espoused sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and, above all, white supremacy. That he was killed doesn’t make him or his views any less odious.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Charlie kirk was a neo nazi. His entire career was built on spreading hate, racism, sexism, homophobia, and dishonesty. He was a free-speech suppressor disguised as a free-speech advocate.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Kirk was a proud white supremacist who used selective passages from the bible to justify his racism, misogyny and homophobia.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. Críticas por Misoginia y Sexismo.</h2><p class="descripcion">La misoginia y el sexismo son señalados como componentes integrales de la retórica de Kirk, con críticas que apuntan a su rol en la difusión de ideas que atentan contra los derechos de las mujeres.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">These people would be gleeful if it were you. Its fine to condemn violence, but charlie kirk was never good faith. Continue his work of what? misogyny? homophobia? racism?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Charlie kirk did not deserve to die for his beliefs. But he was a peddler of misogyny, homophobia and an unapologetic racist who spent his time attempting to poison the minds of young people with his white christian nationalist views that are antithetical to christian teachings.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Kirk's platform — fully objectively, no lies needed — was devoted to spreading racism, misogyny, xenophobia, transphobia, homophobia, and a slew of other hatreds and bigotries.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It is absolutely dishonest to write articles like this without naming the hate spread by kirk. He wasn't 'conservative', he deliberately spread racism, transphobia, homophobia, misogyny &amp; the most horrific misogynoir.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. Señalamientos de Homofobia y Transfobia.</h2><p class="descripcion">La homofobia y la transfobia son temas consistentemente mencionados en las publicaciones, describiendo a Kirk como una figura que dedicó su carrera a atacar a la comunidad LGBTQ+.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It's not hate speech to rightly criticize a man who spent his career spreading homophobia, transphobia, and sexism. Charlie kirk made the world a worse for everyone not like him and he doesn't deserve to be celebrated.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">If charlie kirk’s homophobia, racism, and misogyny was political speech, then acts of violence against lgbtq, brown people, and women should be considered “political violence” as well.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">When you say charlie kirk was killed for being christian, what you're really saying is kirk's racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and fascist idolatry are the core, immutable, non-negotiable tenents of your christian faith.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I strongly oppose racism, transphobia, and homophobia, which charlie kirk has repeatedly promoted in public. That said, no one should ever be killed for their views. I absolutely condemn violence.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. Condena a la Violencia sin Santificación.</h2><p class="descripcion">Un tema central es la doble postura de condenar el asesinato de Kirk y, al mismo tiempo, rechazar cualquier intento de presentarlo como un mártir o de ignorar el daño causado por su retórica.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">We can condemn violence without whitewashing and excusing harm that the victim perpetrated prior to his death. Charlie kirk made a living promoting white supremacy, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Charlie kirk didn’t deserve to die, but he was an extremist. Shame on every mainstream media institution who has tried to rewrite his legacy. His real legacy is filled with racism, misogyny, homophobia, and hate. Don’t make this man a martyr.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Political violence is never acceptable. Charlie kirk promoted hatred, bigotry, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, oppression of women, unrestricted access to guns, and health misinformation, among other things. You don't have to accept normalization of any of that just because he's dead.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Charlie kirk is no martyr. Charlie kirk was a horrible bigot who promoted violence, racism, misogyny, homophobia and transphobia. Charlie kirk was the worst of america. Those claiming he is a martyr are just as bad as he was.</span></li></ul></div></div>
