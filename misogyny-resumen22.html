<h1>22. Misoginia en la política y medios del Reino Unido: un análisis crítico</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. Misoginia en el Gobierno y Partidos Políticos.</h2><p class="descripcion">La misoginia es un problema recurrente y profundamente arraigado en las estructuras de poder del Reino Unido, afectando a diversas formaciones políticas como el Partido Laborista, los Conservadores, Reform UK y el SNP. Se manifiesta en comentarios despectivos, ataques personales y la subestimación de la competencia de las mujeres en cargos públicos, a menudo disfrazada de crítica política.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">This is due to the speaker being a useless piece of work. I suggest she's not only a woman but a labour woman. Misogyny rife, plunging women down into ever more danger - this is from our highest office in the uk?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny is in the heart of our government despite claims to the contrary. Many people in britain don't know that they are misogynistic. It's subtle, but it's real, and this appointment proves it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny is rife within the labour party. Hrre’s another example. ‘why are the knives out for bridget phillipson’?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Labour is a party of rank misogyny. That’s how ‘gender critical’ has taken such a hold. I also don’t care what nigel farage thinks about women. Of course he’s a sexist.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">This party has been accused of huge levels of misogyny from the very top down and it’s certainly living up to that….</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It's very telling the state of the uk, that the moment two women are involved with something publicly, all the misogynists (men and women) come out of the woodwork. Badenoch and reeves are truly horrible fucking people, but you do not have to resort to misogyny to make your point.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny &amp; jealousy. Why only *now*? she's been in the shadow front lines since she, ed miliband, and ed balls marched into greggs to buy pastys.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The tories, and their successor in starmer, are against any inquiry, because it would unearth the racism, misogyny, paedophilia, gender violence and corruption that plagues this country.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. El Papel de los Medios de Comunicación.</h2><p class="descripcion">Los medios de comunicación británicos son señalados como cómplices y amplificadores de la misoginia, especialmente hacia las mujeres en la política. Se les acusa de utilizar un lenguaje despectivo, centrarse en aspectos personales en lugar de políticas, y de tener un sesgo inherente que contribuye a la hostilidad generalizada.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I'm definitely no apologist for labour or for reeves but the media coverage of her being upset has been disgusting and absolutely reeks of misogyny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The right wing ownership of the british press aren’t averse to using classism &amp; misogyny to undermine women of differing political outlook. Increased social media threats against female politicians here too.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It’s 100% misogyny one of the key drivers behind the far right chris mason has an agenda to attack only female labour mps or staff by the looks of it musk farage trump all white male supremacists farage will run the exact same playbook as trump if he’s allowed to be musked into power.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny is rife in criticisms of labour - from both left &amp; right "rachel from accounts" "angela's legs/dress sense/voice" "oh, she changed her hair colour while screwing the poor" i really don't blame any woman who bites her lip &amp; keeps in the background rather than take on a public role.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Funny watching liberals claim the media attacking reeves for her dishonesty and incompetence is misogyny. She’s the chancellor of the exchequer and an incredibly lousy one at that. Being a woman doesn’t shield her from criticism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The press treatment of this, including today at the nhs announcement, has been utterly appalling. The british media are an absolute disgrace, as intellectually vacuous as they are politically absurd. A woman had a shitty day, at home or at work, so the fuck what. I fear misogyny at work here.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The misogyny is real for all to see from the bbc &amp; especially chris mason. I don’t remember him calling out previous chancellors. I hope he never gets anything wrong on his cv. Allegedly he’s a journalist.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny rules. She's the chancellor of the uk exchequer and a mainstream media outlet refers to her as "rachel from accounts". We never heard about kwasi from kounting or nadhim from numbers or rishi from revenue.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The media’s vicious treatment of lindsay lohan was the apogee of noughties popular misogyny.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. Interseccionalidad de la Misoginia.</h2><p class="descripcion">La misoginia no opera de forma aislada, sino que se entrelaza con otras formas de discriminación como el racismo, el clasismo, la xenofobia y la transfobia. Esta combinación crea un entorno más hostil para las mujeres, especialmente aquellas de minorías étnicas o de clase trabajadora, y es a menudo instrumentalizada por la extrema derecha.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny goes hand in hand with racism, xenophobic nationalism, class hierarchies anti queer/trans thinking, ableism and most other forms of oppression and discrimination. It’s the reproduction of patriarchal/colonial systemic power. Not surprising that brexit adds to this extreme right agenda.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Abuse of rayner seems more rooted in misogyny and classism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">As you are aware i am no labour supporter but the classism and misogyny towards reeves and rayner is sicking. Sturgeon had it as well. Of course question policy but it's a nasty undertone of "people like them" shouldn't be in charge which is sickening.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The combination of brexit-support with misogyny and climate change denial is unfortunately the usual.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Racism &amp; misogyny rampant in england. Made worse of course by our media, far right media podcasts, racists on the street &amp; police.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The misogyny and working class hate of the rayner thing is just mind blowing. Of course, rich, chancer chauvinist men get away with this shit all the time, let off by rich, chauvinist mates in the press.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny identified as breeding ground for extremism in uk, says leaked report.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The impression i always got from it was that the bit that particularly drove the uk press mad with her was that she "didn't know her place", which if you pull it apart is a strong combination of misogyny, racism, and classism, but of those racism playing the lesser role than the other two.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">This is an act of violence, racism, and misogyny. This attack exposes the myth of the far right claiming to defend women &amp; girls. Their real agenda is racism.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. Debates sobre la Legislación contra la Misoginia.</h2><p class="descripcion">La implementación de leyes específicas contra la misoginia ha sido un tema de debate y controversia, especialmente en Escocia, donde los planes para una nueva ley han sido pospuestos o abandonados. Esto plantea preguntas sobre la voluntad política para abordar la misoginia de manera efectiva y las complejidades de su definición legal.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Breaking: scottish government drops plans for new misogyny law the government says there is not enough time to introduce a new misogyny law before next year's. Via bbc news misogyny introduce scottish what's your take on this?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">*scottish government drops misogyny bill* globally we are seeing a terrifying rise in misogyny, driven by the far right. This is making life more dangerous for women &amp; girls and is eroding human rights. Scotland is not immune from these forces. The need for effective action is increasing by the day.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Ffs snp. :( :( :( (and we can wait in vain for a single "gender critical" supposed-feminist to speak out against the dropping of the misogyny bill. They don't care a damn about women.).</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Breaking: scottish ministers shelve plans for new misogyny law the government says there is not enough time to introduce a new misogyny law before next year's. Via bbc news introduce misogyny scottish what's your take on this?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Scottish government drops plans for new misogyny law getty images protestors at a uk women's march in edinburgh in january, highlighting a rise in misogyny the scottish government has confirmed it will not bring forward planned legislation to criminalise misogyny before next year's holyrood….</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The scottish government has abandoned the bills on misogyny and conversion practices bans due to the need to address the aftermath of the supreme court judgment. Victory for women huh?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The scottish government's shelving of a new law to criminalise misogyny is a part of a wider retreat in the face of "anti-woke" sentiment baroness helena kennedy kc led an independent expert group that called for new criminal offences targeting prejudice &amp; contempt for women.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I'm not that fussed if the snp shelve the misogyny law because you know at the moment it would only be used by transphobes to silence critics.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Scottish government drops plans for new misogyny law government law legislation misogyny.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>5. Figuras Públicas y la Promoción de la Misoginia.</h2><p class="descripcion">Ciertas figuras públicas, como Nigel Farage y Andrew Tate, son identificadas como promotoras activas de la misoginia, a menudo bajo el pretexto de defender la "cultura masculina" o la "libertad de expresión". Sus comentarios y asociaciones contribuyen a normalizar actitudes perjudiciales y a la radicalización de jóvenes.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I cannot tell you how apoplectic i am about nigel farage &amp; andrew tate. I have three very good reasons. Misogyny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Farage is s friend of tates, trump and yet so called labour voters vote reform? we need to talk about misogyny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Farages' comments are designed to inflamed, but should be ignored by the media or mocked for their appalling misogyny and hatred. Farage is a monster.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Women literally voting for misogyny farage previously dismissed gender disparities in business as a result of men being more willing to “sacrifice family lives” — and praised far-right influencer andrew tate, charged with rape by as an “important voice” for “emasculated” men.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Farage and reform supporters are just the sorts of people who would abuse and harass female bar staff and workers and call it banter they are champions of misogyny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"we're protect our ladies.(because they are our property)" nigelfarage farage trump misogyny patriarchy.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Farage and reform are also promoting toxic masculinity just like trump did. Notice the focus on young men ,nothing about young women , tackling misogyny and domestic violence, because that's too woke.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Nigel farage has surrounded himself with rapists, sex traffickers, and women batterers, even his 31 year old nephew has just been found guilty of and admitted to “upskirting”. What does that say about misogyny and sexual abuse in politics? “but pakistanis” says rape defender farage.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Starmer said farage is “on the wrong side of parents who don’t want their kids being drawn into that world”. He said influencers like tate draw in young men “with the lure of being a strong, successful, wealthy man. But locked in and alongside it, misogyny.”.</span></li></ul></div></div>
