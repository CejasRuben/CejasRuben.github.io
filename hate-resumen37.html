I can say not interested or report them if they are truly bad, but not interested only really means yt will stop suggesting it to me. For a while.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate the person i become when im alone and cranky a ugc ad for a meal delivery kit came up when i was trying to watch a voice ref youtube video, and the person had a lot of mouth noise, and i said out loud drink a glass of water, damn and for what?? leave that girl alone!!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Facebook inserts unskippable ads in reels now. I hate it. Yt also tries to make you feel guilty for skipping ads because content creator revenue.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Google we dont care how much you hate ads give us your money and fuck you if you use ad block we will try our best to fuck your youtube experience up if you use it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Every fucking ad break on youtube is for some shitass slop mobile game now i hate it so much.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I really hate how when i play youtube videos to listen to while drivin, there are soo many ads and its always loud and annoyin and long and i have to reach out to my phone to skip da ad but i cant cuz im drivin!!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Just tried watching a stream only to get a duolingo ad then a character ai ad then the first thing i see is the yt ai chat summary and i felt a a.m. Level amount of hate in an instant.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate when theres a video of the cutest cat or dog ive ever seen and when i unmute hoping to hear the sounds it makes im instead greeted by some dumb song.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate adverts. Of any kind. I think they actively diminish our quality of life and possibly cause cancer.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Something that is making me lose my rag at the moment is that fucking vodafone ad with the dumbass animal and that fucking 80s song i hate it i hate it i mute it but the song is in my head and i will never use vodafone.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I actually hate this ad and feel like i get dumber every time i see it, but ya know, same thing.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate tooth paste and tooth brush adverts when all the people are really close to the camera and showing their teeth or worse yet just smiling aggressively and looking right into the lens.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Is it virgin? just goes to show how much i hate the ad the muting helped at least.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Commercials drive me nuts!.

I hate everythuijg.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Ads for the ability to stream games you own is weird i hate the whole idea but that specifically is weird.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate that sponsors were the answer to youtubes horrible copyright claim system. Even worse is just seeing so many channels just take these sponsors.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Hate getting an ad before watching a skit because i always think its part of the skit.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Really hate celebrity usage in adverts. Its like hey im famous person! buy this thing because its a good deal! like shut up. Youre famous and rich. As if you have any idea what youre shilling and just want an easy paycheck. Not that i blame them for that but still.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Gambling ads and sora ai slop videos is all i see now online. I fucking hate it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">One of the local food delivery apps has this ad campaign lately that goes why book seats in your own apartment? because youve ordered food! where every single shot has these jerky, hollowed-out automaton people doing exaggerated zaanyy things and i hate it so fucking much.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate commercials that attempt to mimic tiktokinfluencer videos. Just shoot a regular ass commercial.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I see those fucking ads all over the millennial fucktwits of mountain views googleyoutube cause the untaxed unregulated unpublishers of amygdala driven hate machine algorithm ad revenue will do anything for , the health of the country the hoi polloi be damned.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate that i have to literally close my eyes, look away, and hum during ad break all month.

Really dont want them in my car - particularly when theyre not paying me to drive it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I truly hate zuckerbergs companies and what they do to sell ads. Awful people.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate that i know exactly what video this is because ive been getting it on my home page.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate that youtube now lists all the people in a video in the creator slot, because it causes me to think theyve made me follow people i dont or necessarily want to follow.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate when i watch people almost get what is going on and then actively chose their default programming. Its pathetic.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate when i wanna watch a commentary youtube video and the person in it is just screaming at me the entire time.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Jfc! i hate these kind of ads, im not interested in this game at all but literally pressed on the button like 5 times and each time it redirected me to the playstore i got annoyed enough to start recording, like.doing this will make me want to play your game even less, gtfo! annoyingads.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Oh the cycle of i hate ads and never want to see them again that forms into i have to look for ads and i want to see what they look like starts again.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate these as well. I understand they need to make money, but then ill never know what is going on because im not paying for it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate these so much, and im so frustrated by all the people i like and respect who keep sharing the fucking things.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate this so, so much - especially since i associate that ad with a vaporwave song i like.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate this i should not have to examine a funny short video to make sure its real.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate to praise youtube especially since id bet they just want people to stop using subscriptioms feed and fully follow the algo but the most relevant feature has consistently given me videos i somehow missed that i actually wanted to see.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate watching these cause i can see the time i left behind.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate when a websitesocial media rolls out a bad update slowly and you just see your friends complaining about how ass it is and you just gotta sit there and wait for your inevitable annoyance when it finally hits you. Anyways i dislike the new youtube player.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate when im watching a video from someone whose content ive enjoyed a lot and they drop a so i asked chatgpt in there. Hard to make me go from subscribed to do not recommend me these videos faster.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate when they have me doing the pedophilia on video!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate when you can feel the sponsor deals and other partnerships going on. Which feels like the bulk of youtubers after a certain size. The top 5 product video was just a means to advertise the one conveniently placed at number 2. So throw in blood money. Come on man.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I only ever see people going i hate all this video! and i never see people going damn, all this text fucking sucks.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I really hate how when i play youtube videos to listen to while drivin, there are soo many ads and its always loud and annoyin and long and i have to reach out to my phone to skip da ad but i cant cuz im drivin!!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I really hate the way that some more news does its members only videos because its flooding my feed with unwatchable videos.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I really tried learning about the reels, tiktoks, hooks. Tried recording these and i feel like some kind of a bird that tries to swim by wearing artificial fins. I like analysis, i studied it, i practice it. I hate breaking news. I hate clickbait. I like real news. Thats what onest is.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I really, really hate the gating of knowledge behind paywalls im not gonna lie. More direct teaching? sure, thats fine because youre spending time on each person and helping them personally. But like, a fucking pdf or pre-recorded video? nah. No matter how cheap i feel it preys on the-.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I scroll past the stories because it literally gives me a sick feeling in my stomach. I fking hate it!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I will not watch a video if i can read an article just like i will not make a call if i can communicate in a text or email. Not because im old or because im young or whatever ageist bullshit because i hate people.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I wish that the uks laws regarding social media endorsement of products were universal, especially regarding clarity between content and advertisements. I hate the trend of a video leading you down the garden path on a subject before going hey check out this product wow - its just scummy.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">If i hate one thing on this earth it is these stupid ads on nascar dot com when the car goes across the page and the whole screen turns clickable for that ad.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Im convinced at this point that youtube just hate their users. Only a few hours ago, i was able to watch videos without needing to disable my ad blocker and i even have yt premium. Now i suddenly cant watch anything unless i turn the ad blocker off.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Its that time of year again falun gong adverts are coming into my youtube ads, and the promotion of a homophobic, racist, anti-science hate-religion is immune from flagging because google and alphabet inc dont care where the ad money comes from if they can get away with it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Its always the cute animal videos, some are so obvious and i hate that i mightve reposted some too.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Its giving toddler thats proud he shit his own pants seriously i hate this new ad they put in for lucky eggs every time you earn 10k xp.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Just found out that some folks actually disliked my mvp clips i put on my youtube for squirrel girl and mr. Fantastic. Im both amused and kind of insulted, because theyre like 30 seconds. 30 seconds of gameplay upsets you that badly? yall hate doreen and reed that badly? lol.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Kroger has been featuring the krojis krogeremoji in their advertising campaigns for a few years now and i cannot put my finger on exactly why i hate them so. I will drive 10 miles out of my way to go to a safeway just to avoid supporting these abominations.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Lmao i rlly hate the interface or like design or wtvr for yt shorts so i never watch them.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Makes me wish there was a bit more quality control on what you can get revenue for on youtube. Some peoples whole platform is build on hate and grifting.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Man i hate that if you want to get the best out of a youtube video, you better immediately turn it off of auto.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Man, i wish that the uks laws regarding social media endorsement of products were universal, especially regarding clarity between content and advertisements. I hate the trend of a video leading you down the garden path on a subject before going hey check out this product wow - its just scummy.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Me showing up to the function to hate on youtubers that have done nothing to upset me but just give me a little bad vibe.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Most of whats on youtube i hate most of whats on twitch i hate most of whats on the internet i hate. Like almost every out there on the web is just low effort low quality content. The worst part is people eat it up like theyre at a trough.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Not sure who needs to hear this but if you put ads in the middle of a video on youtube the odds im subscribing to your channel or buy that thing being advertised are less than zero. When did advertising become lets annoy people to where they hate us and will never buy our products or services?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Ohmygod why the fuck does hbo have pause ads now, on an ad-free plan !?? jesus fucking christ i hate this capitalist bullshit! every single company now just looks to see what extra shit they can get away with pushing, and every product or service just gets worse and worse and worse constantly.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Personally i hate most of the videos and just want the information written down rather than wait for someone to get through talking to me.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Probably going to move to web version and use firefox since adblock still works on there. I hate web youtube on mobile, but im so done with the far-right propaganda and ai generated shit. Its dystopian.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Reels is a sewer. I truly hate zuckerbergs companies and what they do to sell ads. Awful people.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Really hate sites with a payout system i have money sitting on my twitch account that i earned through streaming that i just cant do anything with bc i havent hit the payout threshhold yet and i might not ever bc idk if im gonna stream anymore so they just have my earnings hostage.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Same here. I deeply hate video content. Give me text fuck i miss blogs, although substack has revived that or audio.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">So weird to me. I hate all forms of advertising and always have. As soon as someone tries to sell me something its an instant turnoff. Any sort of attempt at sales has the exact opposite of the intended effect on me.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Thelyonfirm.comblogjeep-da. I hate the ads at the gas station. Really dont want them in my car - particularly when theyre not paying me to drive it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Ugh i hate this for you also i feel like any youtuber who got their start more recently wouldve like found you and interviewed you as part of the video??</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Ughghg i hate this. There are some japanese language peeps whose content i like but the thumbnail is always dont say this or japanese people will hate you and punch your dog.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Youtube premium baybee genuinely i hate paying money to a massive coproration but i hate ads more.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. Aversión al Formato "Shorts" y Contenido de Baja Calidad.</h2><p class="descripcion">Muchos usuarios critican el formato de videos cortos "Shorts", comparándolo desfavorablemente con TikTok y Facebook, y quejándose de la falta de control del usuario y la proliferación de contenido de baja calidad y generado por IA.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Hate youtube shorts. Stupid format takes away all user controls and looks like fucking facebook.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Things i increasingly dislike 1. Youtube shorts and tiktok 2. Streaming services - and subscriptions in general 3. All ai slop 4. Videos with the words playing on the top of them 5. The difficulty of filtering out specific content you dont like i hate the future. Damn kids get off my lawn.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I have a bizarre hate for youtube shorts that loop into themselves. Do not do this to me. I do not plan to watch it twice in a row. Give me closure.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate youtube! at least give me the option to convert to shorts if i wanted to ugly feature!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate how little of a backbone companies have and are just willing to let the worst things on the planet be platformed on their own site youtube has had some real slop or just flat out bigotry overtake the site and they seemingly dont have any issues with it as long as they get money, bleh.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate that it encourages content that has no explanation or method. No personality or anything. How so much content is scripted to repeat into itself as if youre going to watch it more than once before closing the window. Im tired of the ai voices over everything.-.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate that mindlessly scrolling youtube has become a minefield. I hate that people cant wait two friggin days.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate these so much, and im so frustrated by all the people i like and respect who keep sharing the fucking things.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate these fucking vapid, pointless, cookie cutter ai-generated webtoon manhwa ads. Theyre all the same tawdry useless shit and i am actually begging them to leave me the fuck alone.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate youtube so much. You build up a monopoly on internet video streaming and you decide to make it as impossible as fucking possible to actually just watch the video. Eat shit.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I praise the youtube and the youtube taketh. Ofc they are still at war with adblockers. By the stars, i fucking hate them.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I really hate how even youtube has forced creators to be awful diminish their content or at least make their content appear junky. Like having to make stupid catchy headlines or stupid thumbnails to catch your eye. Some of us who still have critical thinking skills are actually looking for quality.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I think its funny they have to advertise around people seem to hate this and we dont know why.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I think its a bit of a miracle that youtube is still around with how much theyre doing everything for everyone to hate it goes with most social medias though.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I truly hate that i dont have the discipline to go the e-newsletter route, while at the same time im too self-aware to think that anyone wants to listenwatch me via a podcast or youtube or whatever. 140 characters at a time was perfect for j-sports degenerates.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I watch a decent amount of wrestling content on youtube and ive managed to clear out most of the just hate content but for some reason youtube keeps trying to feed me stevie richards and his little hate nugget buddy. Its the drizzling shits and i cant get away from it. Wrestlesky.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I watch a lot of youtube so having premium has been nice. Every once in a while ill watch a video for something for work and ill get hit with ads and it reminds me how much i hate ads we just canceled hulu and i might not extend gamepass core or essential or whatever they call it now.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I was trying to record a video for my gfm earlier today, to try and maybe get more attention on it. And i hated everything about it. I looked bad. And i sound worse. I just sound like a goofy southerner. I hate it so much.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I wish that the uks laws regarding social media endorsement of products were universal, especially regarding clarity between content and advertisements. I hate the trend of a video leading you down the garden path on a subject before going hey check out this product wow - its just scummy.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I fucking hate youtube.
