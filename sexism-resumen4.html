<h1>4. Sexismo y Racismo: Factores Clave en la Derrota Electoral</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. El Sexismo como Causa Principal.</h2><p class="descripcion">Numerosos usuarios argumentan que el sexismo fue el factor determinante en el resultado electoral, sugiriendo que el electorado estadounidense se opone más a una presidenta mujer que a un presidente de otra raza, citando las derrotas consecutivas de candidatas frente al mismo oponente masculino.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It was first &amp; foremost sexism, not racism. When it comes to electing a president, it’s now been definitively proven that america is much more vehemently opposed to having a woman president than it is to having a black male president. The dem party cannot afford to nominate a woman candidate again.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">She lost because she’s a woman. Sexism exists. It’s real. It hurt her campaign. It’s unlikely any other changes could have overcome the sexism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">There’s way too much sexism in america. That’s why two female candidates for president have lost. Sometimes it’s that simple.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The sexism was enough. Any woman, no matter who she was was going to lose. And if we pick one for our nominee in 2028 we'll lose then, too.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Unfortunately sexism is still rampant enough in this country to make that a losing battle. Notice how trump lost to a man but won against two women. We have to fix sexism in this country before we get there. An issue that should never have been an issue.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It was sexism, first and foremost. America elected and re-elected a black president. But, america has rejected women presidential candidates every time. Sadly, until that sexist bias/mindset is changed, we cannot nominate another woman candidate for president again.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. La Intersección de Sexismo y Racismo.</h2><p class="descripcion">Esta perspectiva sostiene que el sexismo y el racismo no pueden separarse y que ambos jugaron un papel crucial y entrelazado en la derrota, especialmente al tratarse de una candidata que es una mujer de color.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">And that’s the main reason why kamala lost. Racism, sexism, and misogyny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">You just wont admit that sexism and racism of the american people is the majority reason why she lost.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Some people like to downplay the role sexism and racism played in this election. I really wish people weren't in such denial.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Let’s cut the bs—we know exactly why kamala lost. If a white man had run that exact campaign, he would’ve won in a landslide. We lost out on an amazing president bc racism and sexism are so deeply woven into the fabric of this country even democrats aren’t immune.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I’m convinced that the primary reason kamala lost was cause she was a woman, and worse, a brown one. That’s it. None of this policy navel gazing. Just straight up sexism and racism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">She lost because so many people in this country couldn't stand the idea of a black woman being president. Racism and sexism is the simple answer.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. Debate: ¿Qué Pesó Más, Sexismo o Racismo?</h2><p class="descripcion">Los comentarios en esta sección comparan la influencia del sexismo frente al racismo, a menudo citando la elección de Barack Obama como prueba de que el sexismo es un obstáculo mayor en la política presidencial estadounidense.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I think sexism had a bigger impact than racism on the election. Just a hunch.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I don’t think it’s racism as much as sexism. Hillary lost to trump, too. And we did elect barack obama twice. I’m no political scientist. I just have two eyes, a heart, and a brain.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sexism played it's part too. Case in point: a black man has been elected. A woman? never.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Yeah it was definitely more sexism than anything else. Many people were saying they weren’t going to vote for her because they didn’t believe a woman could lead a country which is ridiculous and they obviously never picked up a history book. Obama won and he was black. 100% sexism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">As much as i want to blame racism for this loss, we have to remember that america voted for a black man. Twice. So while racism definitely played a part, we have to accept that it was mostly sexism. We didn't elect the white lady either. The patriarchy is strong.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Us elected a black man for president, but decided the treasonous vulgarian white man was a better choice than a woman - twice. Not denying racism is a thing, but it can't hold a candle to sexism.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. Contraargumentos: Campaña, Políticas y Candidatura.</h2><p class="descripcion">Un grupo de usuarios, si bien no niega la existencia del sexismo y el racismo, argumenta que la derrota se debió principalmente a una mala campaña, políticas poco atractivas o la percepción de la candidata, considerando que culpar únicamente a los "ismos" es una excusa para no analizar los errores estratégicos.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">In the end she was a poor candidate that was unliked. Saying it was sexism/racism is an excuse to not take a moment &amp; reflect on why the democrats lost running on don’t believe your eyes and your reality about the economy, crime, immigration… believe what we tell you. It didn’t work.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Not that sexism and racism didn't play a role, but she was also a bad candidate who ran a bad campaign. There's a reason she was one of the first people to drop out in 2020!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The campaign was absolute garbage. That's why she lost, not racism or sexism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Not the racism and sexism cope again. Why did the other candidate with dark skin - obama - win? why did the other candidate with a vagina - clinton - win the popular vote? women can win. Minorities can win. Shit candidates who run shit campaigns cannot. Yall have endless excuses tbh. It's wild.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It wasn't racism or sexism. She's not a victim and not blameless. She lost because of dem voters, not maga voters. Trump's base stayed the same. 10 million dem voters couldn't stomach voting for an administration overrun by radical zionists and proudly facilitating a livestreamed genocide.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">We could have easily had a female president -- two at this point. They didn't lose because of racism or sexism -- they lost because they were terrible candidates with awful policies (if they had any) and awful political instincts, and because the party has repeatedly failed and abandoned its base.</span></li></ul></div></div>
