<h1>21. Sexismo en la Medicina: Un Problema Sistémico Persistente</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. Diagnóstico y Desestimación del Dolor Femenino.</h2><p class="descripcion">Numerosos testimonios denuncian cómo los profesionales de la salud minimizan o ignoran los síntomas de las mujeres, atribuyéndolos a causas psicológicas como la ansiedad o la "histeria", lo que retrasa diagnósticos cruciales y perpetúa el sufrimiento.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sexism is woven into the fabric of the greatestmedicalscandal , our serious disease is treated like “girls are just crazy.” this is a huge story just waiting for attention. Johnvsjonvsme . Meme c/o .</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sexism is weird. Women are treated as fragile things until they have any health issue or chronic pain and then it’s ’you’re overreacting, endure it’.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Men have been labeling women crazy, hormonal, hysterical, or some variant thereof for millennia now. This sexism creates many social barriers and barriers in the workplace, not to mention that it literally gets us killed. Women's symptoms &amp; pain are frequently dismissed or blamed on mental illness.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">If medical sexism would be addressed, we wouldn't end up with misdiagnoses that are literally modern versions of hysteria for most complex chronic illness in women, and often even for cancer. Because it shouldn't take years on end for a diagnosis of ms. People shouldn't be gaslit and let to suffer.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">My wife has a motor neuron disease - a severe one. I can't tell you how many doctors claimed it was psychosomatic or a bid for attention. I have my own autoimmune issue. While much less serious than my wife's, not one doctor (out of 20, give or take) ever doubted me. Sexism is real.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. Un Problema Sistémico y Patriarcal.</h2><p class="descripcion">El sexismo en la medicina no es un conjunto de incidentes aislados, sino un problema estructural arraigado en el patriarcado. Esto se refleja en la investigación médica, que históricamente ha utilizado sujetos masculinos como norma, resultando en un conocimiento deficiente sobre la salud de las mujeres.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Oh the sexism inherent in these diagnoses is not simple. Its systemic, patriarchal, and the depth of these biases is just beginning to come to light. Of course there are other ableist, racist, etc angles embedded within, but the sexism is huge. It's why there are more barriers for my dtr than my son.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Also scientific sexism - primarily using male subjects from animals to humans in medical research has wreaked havoc on women’s health.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Unfortunately a huge amount of our foundational medical data was gathered with very few women or poc in the mix. The sexism is baked in deep :/.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">My experience as a girl woman with one disease after another that medicine has shitall to offer has informed every aspect of my worldview. It all stems from sexism, and, from there, extends to the white supremacist patriarchy that only values white cis men views the rest of us as disposable.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I don't know why this is even news. Women have always known this. It isn't in our imaginations. Many of us tracked our symptoms and figured out the correlation. I don't think of myself as a feminist, but good grief, why could our (mostly male) doctors not just, you know, believe us? sexism lives.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. Interseccionalidad: Cuando el Sexismo se Cruza con el Racismo y el Capacitismo.</h2><p class="descripcion">La discriminación se agrava cuando el sexismo se combina con otros prejuicios como el racismo y el capacitismo. Las mujeres de color, las mujeres con discapacidad y las personas neurodivergentes enfrentan barreras adicionales para recibir un diagnóstico y tratamiento adecuados.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Black women experience both sexism and racism in the medical system, you dolt. The problems in our health system are widespread, systemic, and baked in racist/misogynistic ideology.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It is a mix of sexism and ableism. I was a victim of this sexism and ableism. What boys, girls, men, and women suffer from in this mental healthcare system industry is unforgivable. Our society is fucked up.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Medicine was the first profession that comes to mind for me. Particularly in certain specialities like surgery. And aside from the way female doctors are treated, sexism in medicine also harms (and kills) female patients - especially women of colour. Good luck getting a pcos dx in under a year.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">This is both sexism and ableism, because it was also the reason why they said bipolar disorder is a 'female' disorder, and anytime a 'male' had symptoms of bipolar they were diagnosed autistic, and anytime a 'female' showed symptoms of autism they got diagnosed bipolar, which harms both sides.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It is incredibly depressing how much racism and sexism and ableism is baked into every medical interaction.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. Consecuencias y Experiencias Personales.</h2><p class="descripcion">Las experiencias personales revelan el impacto directo del sexismo médico: años de espera para un diagnóstico, tratamientos inadecuados y una profunda desconfianza en el sistema. Estas historias subrayan la necesidad urgente de un cambio estructural y de escuchar a las pacientes.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sexism in the medical system often prevents women from accessing diagnosis took me 22 years to bypass systemic sexism and get evaluated (and diagnosed) with asd.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I have to gird myself against sexism every time i go to a doctor. I forget, because i have to keep my questions and factual info in mind, and then they zing me. Damn it. It's inflicting a type of narcissistic abuse trauma, every-day variety, for women and minorities.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">As a man, i’ve definitely been listened to more about concerns i’ve had. I’ve convinced dr’s/nurses to listen to my partner about her conditions as if i vouch that she’s not crazy and somehow my word is more valid. It really worries me how bad medical sexism still is, even by female staff.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Well, given that a lot of women get shitty healthcare from doctors, of all genders, its no wonder they don't trust medical authorities anymore. If this article is correct, fixing sexism among all doctors is the first step.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Medical sexism makes me want to rip all my hair out and stuff it into the persons mouth.</span></li></ul></div></div>
