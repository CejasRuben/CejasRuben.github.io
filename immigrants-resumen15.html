<h1>15. Advierten que los 'campos de concentración' no son solo para inmigrantes</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. La Advertencia Principal: "Nosotros Somos los Siguientes".</h2><p class="descripcion">La idea central que se repite es que los inmigrantes son solo el primer objetivo. Los usuarios expresan un temor generalizado de que, una vez que la población inmigrante sea deportada o encarcelada, estas instalaciones se usarán contra ciudadanos estadounidenses, especialmente aquellos que se oponen al gobierno.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">They are not building these massive concentration camps everywhere to fill with just immigrants. These are for american political prisoners.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It is the next step in their concentration camps, slave labor. And soon they won't be just filled with immigrants, but anyone they consider a political agitator.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Anyone who thinks these concentration camps are only for immigrants needs to pay attention to their history. This doesn’t stop with immigration. They’re already rounding up the homeless and incarcerating them. We’re next.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">They'll start putting americans in the camps they're currently using for immigrants. Immigrants are just the start.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Well, what do ya think they are building concentration camps in every state for? there aren't that many immigrants, folks; they are gearing up to lock up opposition!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">When they run out of immigrants and the migrants stop coming, who do you think will be put in these concentration camps couldn't be american citizen right?(tone/sarcastic).</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">They are claiming to be building them for "illegal" immigrants, but the ultimate prisoners will be all of us citizens that are against their policies. We are watching the nazi playbook in real-time.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Don't we get it yet. The billions being spent for concentration camps across the country aren't for illegal immigrants. Us citizens opposing this fascist administration will be tracked &amp; jailed. Wake up america.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">You didn't think those concentration camps they're building are just for immigrants did you?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">If we the people do not stop them, they will come for everyone who doesn’t swear loyalty eventually. Does anyone really believe that the dozens of enormous concentration camps they are building (with our tax dollars) are just for immigrants?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Those concentration camps aren't for immigrants. They just said that because they knew we wouldnt care if they started rounding up those the usa hates the most. Latinos. Now look. Hatred destroyed the nation. Our kids deserved better from us.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. Expansión del Objetivo: De Inmigrantes a los Sin Techo y Otros Grupos Vulnerables.</h2><p class="descripcion">Más allá de los disidentes políticos, se menciona con frecuencia que otros grupos vulnerables serán los siguientes en ser encarcelados. Las personas sin hogar, con enfermedades mentales, y las comunidades LGBTQ+ son identificadas como objetivos probables para llenar los centros de detención una vez que se agoten los inmigrantes.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sitting up all those concentration camps for political enemies. They don’t have enough immigrants as it is. Talking homeless people and the mentally ill next.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Torture and murder in prisons are the new trump regimes concentration camps for immigrants. How long before homeless, mental health and disabled people get incarcerated in these concentration camps?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Immigration detention centers are concentration camps. When there are no more immigrants to occupy them the camps will be used to hold poc, jews, lgbtq, and dissenters.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Those camps they are building was never just about locking up immigrants. Next, it’s homelessness people and the list will go on and on.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sounds like he’s admitting their grand plan is to imprison all the undesirables. First they came for immigrants next they came for the homeless who’s next….</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Treating unhoused folks, protestors, trans folks, and immigrants as criminals is the next step in the fascist playbook. They already have the concentration camps set up.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">There will be more than immigrants in those concentration camps. The homeless, the lgbtq community, anyone they don't like.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The fascist won't stop with immigrants. "dissidents" and the homeless will be next. The camps are money machines for the contractors who run them, and put cash into local economies for the staffs.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Is this the part where homeless people are put into concentration camps? first they came for the immigrants…then they came for the unhoused….who is next? this is moving so quickly.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. El Negocio de la Detención: Prisiones Privadas y Esclavitud Moderna.</h2><p class="descripcion">Muchos comentarios señalan un motivo económico detrás de la construcción masiva de centros. Se acusa a las corporaciones de prisiones privadas de beneficiarse de contratos gubernamentales para crear un sistema de "esclavitud legal", utilizando a los detenidos como mano de obra barata y generando ganancias a costa del sufrimiento humano y los impuestos de los ciudadanos.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">That’s why they just gave all that cash to private prison companies to expand…. Yes. It is absolutely insane. And cruel. And inhumane. I don’t think for a moment it will be only immigrants housed. We can all see the trajectory.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">They aren’t building those concentration camps just for immigrants. It’s another money robbing &amp; human trafficking scheme to enrich themselves.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">They're removing the immigrants so the owners and investors in for-profit prisons can make more money on slave labor. You know this, adam.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The prison state is legal slavery. Why are they building all those cells if the ”bad guys” are immigrants who will be deported soon?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Reminder: 90% of ice detention facilities are privately owned. Their owners rake in billions by locking up migrants. Rich people bought the news and the government, to make stupid people afraid of immigrants, so they can get even richer.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">When millions are homeless and out of work, i guess they'll round us up, send us to private prisons and force us to work for private corporations or the state.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The for profit prison system is now in the migrant detention aka concentration camp business. Not only do innocent immigrants have to face this regime who want to hunt them down, they also want to profit off of their abuse.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">How about an amendment that detained immigrants can’t be used as a labor pool. Why do you think they’re building huge concentration camps and prison owners are counting the bucks? this is the plan in project 2025.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Greed and grift was all this "mass deportation" bullshit was ever about.the prison industrial complex gets rich by holding noncriminal immigrants endlessly in mass concentration camps.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. Ecos de la Historia: Comparaciones con el Nazismo y Campos de Internamiento.</h2><p class="descripcion">Los usuarios trazan paralelos directos con eventos históricos oscuros, como el Holocausto en la Alemania nazi y los campos de internamiento para japoneses-americanos en EE. UU. durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Se utiliza un lenguaje fuerte como "gulag", "Auschwitz" y "Gestapo" para describir la situación actual, sugiriendo que la historia se está repitiendo de una manera alarmante.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The only reason to have detention centers for immigrants is for temporarily holding immigrants while their legal status is processed. Otherwise they are concentration camps, much like the nazis had.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The u.s. Version of the gulag archipelago, when they get low on immigrants they’ll be coming for you. The administration is building the concentration camps right now.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Does anyone in america think that when all the immigrants are in cages they will stop there? next they will come after black people, gay people and citizens that voice opposition to the regime. Right out of hitlers playbook.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It’s a concentration camp. And it won’t stop with undocumented immigrants. This cannot stand. We’re going to have to denazify the u.s.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump’s blueprint. Build auschwitz 卐 like prisons for immigrants and american born u.s. Citizens he doesn’t like.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Ice is playing the part of the ss, rounding up immigrants instead of jews. They are building concentration camps.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Breaking: they just turned fort bliss into a mass detention camp. Up to 5,00 immigrants will be held in tents. Same place where japanese americans were locked up during wwii.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">What a shame are country didn’t learn anything from the japanese concentration camps that they used during world war two. Now we have them for immigrants seeking a better life and the american dream. This won’t end well.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">All these concentration camps aren't just for immigrants. They should all have the words ,"arbeit macht frei" on the gates into them. If trump follows hitler's playbook, these folks will be forced to work.</span></li></ul></div></div>
