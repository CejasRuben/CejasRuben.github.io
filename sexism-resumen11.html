<h1>11. El Sexismo en el Deporte: Un Problema Persistente y Multifacético</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. La Conexión entre Sexismo y Transfobia.</h2><p class="descripcion">Muchos comentarios argumentan que la oposición a la inclusión de mujeres trans en el deporte está fundamentalmente arraigada en ideas sexistas sobre la inferioridad atlética de las mujeres y en la regulación de las normas de género.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Very telling the main people bringing up trans women in sports are men going on long rants about how biologically inferior women are. I remember when 00’s/10’s feminist media was about girls playing on boy teams because of sexism in sports. I miss those times.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">This is why/how all the discussions against trans women in sport are rooted in plain old sexism: - it’s based on sexist assumptions about women’s athletic ability - it’s primarily about regulating/policing gender norms plus there’s also often an undercurrent of racism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">As always, transphobia is an offshoot of sexism. Sports were initially segregated along gender lines because men were losing to women and didn't like it. Not because men were better.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">If i had to share one clip from john oliver's great segment on the attacks targeting trans athletes all over the globe, it would be this one: attacks against trans women in sports all come down to one single motivator: blatant sexism and gross misogyny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">At this point i don't understand how people deny that transphobic backlash is just pure sexism. How can anyone say "we need segregated sports because women are too frail and biologically inferior to compete with men" and then claim to be a feminist.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. Desigualdad en Medios y Cobertura.</h2><p class="descripcion">Se critica la falta de visibilidad y la cobertura desigual de los deportes femeninos en los medios de comunicación, considerándolo una forma de sexismo que perpetúa la invisibilidad de las atletas y sus logros.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Why is it so hard to report on women’s sport? another day where the bbc do not feature a single sport headline on women’s sport despite 40% of all sport being played by women and women sport, such as the euro final, being the most watch events on tv. Sexism in sport media makes women invisible.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sexism in sports broadcasting is rampant. Women are held out of pbp jobs, often rising no higher than sideline reporters who get little speaking time, subject to "friendly" ridicule that is often sexist from the men in the booth and they can't object to it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Invisible women in sport. Todays bbc sport headlines has one story for women and 4 for men. Women play football, cricket and golf too. But they are sidelined consistently by the bbc reporting. Unequal sports media feeds into inequality in sport salary and opportunity for women. Dobetter sexism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I think the news (sports) media is caught between a rock and a hard place. It has a history of criminally underreporting on women’s sport. In this instance, if it reports a certain way, it could invite claims of sexism and double standards. The media brought this on itself though.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. Raíces Históricas y Estructurales del Sexismo.</h2><p class="descripcion">Los comentarios exploran los orígenes de la segregación por sexo en los deportes, atribuyéndola no a diferencias biológicas insuperables, sino al paternalismo, la misoginia y el deseo de mantener una jerarquía de género.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Does the 'protect womens sports by banning trans women' crowd under the history of sex and gender segregation in sports? the roots of sex and gender segregation in sports aren't womanism, feminism, or egalitarianism, but because of paternalism, sexism, and misogyny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It's a really rubbish truth that the sexism running through society, which created such a big gap between men's and women's sports in the first place, persists and creates further problems when pushing to address that imbalance.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Women's sports was never about being too biologically disadvantaged to compete with boys. It was sexism then the same as it is now.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">We don't actually separate sports by sex because of differences in size and strength. We separate them because of sexism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">In almost every single case, the only reason any sport is segregated by gender is either 1) straight up sexism or 2) a woman started kicking ass so none of the boys wanted to play with her anymore for fear of bruising their egos (marathons, shooting competitions, etc.).</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. Experiencias de Abuso y Discriminación.</h2><p class="descripcion">Se denuncian experiencias directas de sexismo, acoso y la creación de entornos inseguros para las aficionadas y jugadoras, destacando la normalización de comportamientos misóginos en eventos deportivos.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Over half of women have experienced sexist behaviour or language on a matchday, and nearly a quarter say they don't feel safe at games. Sexism has no place in modern football. We must challenge it, report it and kick it out.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Uk - new system for reporting sexism at matches launched after growing abuse of female fans kick it out and her game too work together on initiative more than half have seen sexist behaviour on match-days.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">85% of women who experience or witness sexism or misogyny at football don’t report it if you see, or hear sexism, report it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">In the last week, we’ve seen reports of misogynistic chanting, sexism directed towards women working in football and the vile targeting of players’ partners in stadiums and online. Report sexism and misogyny to us via our website, app, social media or email.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>5. Justificaciones Económicas y Desigualdad.</h2><p class="descripcion">Se señala cómo el discurso económico, a menudo bajo la apariencia de "capitalismo", se utiliza para justificar la brecha salarial y la falta de inversión en los deportes femeninos, enmascarando el sexismo subyacente.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Loving this comments section. "im not transphobic, but let me explain why all women deserve to make less than men in sports. It's capitalism, not sexism.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Racism &amp; sexism often get filtered away thru the "neutral" language of capitalism: "women's sports aren't revenue-generating, so it's smart not to invest, it would be a bad investment." but when this blows up, then it becomes stupid not to invest. But we never address the misogyny &amp; misogynoir.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It’s ironic how much dudes who hate women’s sport will try go ‘it’s basic economics’ as a way to pretend it isn’t just sexism, considering none of those dumbasses know the difference between profit and revenue.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Where’s the equality, hun? they still get paid cents to the dollar of the men even tho they sell out arenas and have higher tv ratings (when they actually get aired)…you people are so delusional. Men may experience racism, but women experience racism and sexism…cope.</span></li></ul></div></div>
