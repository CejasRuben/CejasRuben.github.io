<h1>3. Homofobia y Odio como Motor del Voto a Trump</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. La Tríada del Odio: Racismo, Misoginia y Homofobia.</h2><p class="descripcion">Numerosos comentarios identifican una combinación inseparable de racismo, misoginia y homofobia como la base ideológica fundamental del movimiento MAGA y la principal motivación de sus votantes.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It’s misogyny, racism and homophobia combined. People voted for trump because he hates the same people they hate.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">They all are. That’s what maga is all about. Racism, homophobia and misogyny. Among other disgusting things.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Racism, homophobia and misogyny won. Period. Trump ran on the economy, only. The people still standing by him are consciously racist, homophobic and misogynistic and brain dead.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Racism, misogyny, ableism and homophobia are the central brand of trumps administration. A cocktail of hated, aimed at anyone, who isn’t a straight white male.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It's racism, misogyny and homophobia. All christian values by the way, created and supported by men, white men, here in america. This is the fucking problem. This is maga.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The four pillars of the maga/gop: misogyny, bigotry, homophobia and xenophobia.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. El Voto como Expresión de Intolerancia.</h2><p class="descripcion">Estas publicaciones sostienen que el voto a favor de Trump no fue por razones económicas, como el precio de los huevos, sino una elección consciente a favor de la intolerancia, la crueldad y la discriminación contra diversos grupos.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Voted for trump because he hates the same people they hate. It was never about the price of groceries. It was always about racism, misogyny, homophobia, and xenophobia.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">All those who whined about “the economy” “the price of eggs” deep down it was hatred, bigotry, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny. Maybe some 2016 voters can be excused (personally i don’t think so) but to vote him in again after his 1st term. They wanted hatred and cruelty.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Let’s be real, these folk knew what they were voting for and it wasn’t eggs. It was the racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia and xenophobia. Yeah, eventually they are going to suffer, they may even turn on him, but they won’t stop being bigots.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">People who voted trump/maga did so because they wanted to *harm* other people. They wanted *others* to loose jobs, human rights and freedom. They voted because racism, xenophobia, transphobia and homophobia were not dealbreakers for them. They voted for harm and hate… targeting other people.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Maga does not care about trump’s stupid and inane economic policies. They want racism. They want misogyny. They want homophobia.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. Trump como Catalizador del Odio.</h2><p class="descripcion">Se argumenta que Trump no creó el odio, sino que lo normalizó y legitimó, dando permiso a sus seguidores para expresar abiertamente sus prejuicios preexistentes de racismo, misoginia y homofobia.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump emboldened his supporters to display their racism, misogyny and homophobia. Now we know who they truly are and want nothing to do with them.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It is horrific. Trump owns this. He didn’t originate hatred, racism, misogyny, homophobia - but he nurtures it.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Let’s be honest: trump says everything they are thinking and they see themselves in him. He legitimizes their racism, their misogyny, their homophobia, their transphobia. He allows them to be as vile as they actually are. That is what they voted for.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The hate has been boiling under the surface, simmering and seething with anger for a long time. Trump gave people permission to openly hate again, and that’s how he keeps his base. Overt homophobia, xenophobia, and racism are their reward for obedience to their orange overlord.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny, racism, and homophobia never went away. They just became unfashionable to display publically. Trump made it fashionable, i.e., ok, again.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. La Homofobia como Característica Central de MAGA.</h2><p class="descripcion">Estas citas destacan la homofobia, a menudo junto con la transfobia, como un componente dominante y definitorio de la ideología MAGA, describiéndola como una característica patológica y fundamental del movimiento.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Maga: come for the abject racism directed at every nonwhite on the planet, stay for the virulent homophobia that underlies a deep seated hatred of self. Exquisite.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Homophobia is part of the maga mindset because they don’t have minds. Hitler’s supporters were the same.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The underlying homophobia, transphobia, etc., is a dominating characteristic of maga. I believe it is a collective repression of sexual desires, expressed as projection and self-loathing. Their obsession with others’ sexual lives is pathological and violent. Sad!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Friendly reminder that anyone who voted for trump cosigned his misogyny, which is the bedrock of homophobia. So, it is not possible to be a feminist or lgbtqia ally and vote for trump. Sorry, i don't make the rules. Bigotry is bigotry.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">This whole sham works because maga are unserious hyper-partisans addicted to racial animus and homophobia.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Not all trump supporters are homophobes— but all of them decided that homophobia wasn’t a deal breaker. Not all trump supporters are sexual abusers— but all of them decided that sexual abuse wasn’t a deal breaker.</span></li></ul></div></div>
