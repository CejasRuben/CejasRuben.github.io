Críticas al Colonialismo Francés.</h2><p class="descripcion">El colonialismo francés en África es objeto de numerosas críticas, desde la explotación económica hasta la imposición cultural y la violencia histórica.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"can't wait until france discovers that colonialism is bad and sometimes is aided from within.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"god almost every time macron opens his mouth about africa and french colonialism it leaves me gobsmacked.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"france exploits us, we got rid of french colonialism as a russian colony. Long live fully independent africa".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the french still make their former colonies pay them.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"i feel like no other country has made themselves more dependent on neo-colonialism than france has.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"former french colonies are still paying a ‘colonial’ tax but people wanna act like colonialism is a thing of the past.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"france has no position left in africa. There is literally only one or two west african governments which are not directly hostile to france. Colonialism still exists, but it's mostly africans between themselves, or russians, arabs and chinese interests.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the more apt analogy is if you (french) criticized an african country for not paying off loans meant to develop the nation after y’all bled them dry through colonialism…wait-".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"france's president emmanuel macron accused of 'contempt' over africa remarks ijs: who invited them into africa? all they brought was racism, slavery and misery. France wants an apology? wtf!! where is the apology for their greed resulting in slavery and colonialism?".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"fuck president macron. He's trying to assassinate a black president for trying to end colonialism and france's slavery of child gold miners. He refuses to leave africa because france's entire economy depends on black slavery. Fuck france. Leave africa the fuck alone. Now!!".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"so french colonialism never ended and america was always just a tool of french power, and i shouldn't even be saying this because the french have nuclear submarines parked off my country now ostensibly to protect us from the usa. Cool. Cool cool cool.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the french are in a tight spot. Those who have any sense will move to any far-off place that has not suffered at the hands of french colonialism.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"france practices economic colonialism by taking 85% of the annual revenue from the francophone countries. These countries must then borrow money from france to fulfil obligations to their people. Countries that refuse to be drained by the 85% tax often experience a coup.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the french revolution had a lot of promise but unfortunately it just led to napoleon taking it over as an emperor and creating the most brutal french colonialism in their history. That's why this isn't a great shirt tbh. Now if you would've said russia in 1917, a truly proletarian cause.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"france's economic colonialism explained in the mail &amp; guardian. France takes 85%, the african country then applies to the french bank for funds to cover its dire finances.and of course the french limit the amounts the country can request. France is a predatory lender.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the french had managed to bring some stability to mali, for example. For some years they had an amazing world music festival. But the government decided it was all 'colonialism' and now loo at mali! a total disaster for everyone who lives there".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"it’s in the editorial line of the french left since jules ferry’s speech on the mission to civilise indigenous peoples in africa and around the world. That editorial could have been pulled from the 90s but now, we need the left to understand that white saviorism is also a form of colonialism.".</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. El Legado del Colonialismo Belga en el Congo.</h2><p class="descripcion">El colonialismo belga en el Congo, particularmente bajo el reinado de Leopoldo II, es recordado por su brutalidad extrema y explotación despiadada de los recursos naturales y la población.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"belgium coming out as the dark horse against colonialism is an interesting development".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"as a belgian i feel the shame for when they didn't. Colonialism, slavery are a stain on world history.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"congo vs. Apple theft of minerals and collusion belgium and france neocolonialism &amp; genocide of the congolese people damn!".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the so-called "dr congo" is only a sinister heritage of the catastrophic belgian colonialism which produced absolutely no local educated elites and promoted ethnic rivalries to ensure belgian "interests" after independence. It has always been a failed state, it should rather be fully dismantled".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"fuck you belgium (trigger warning for almost everything) jesus christ, every time i'm reading about colonialism, i think 'now there can't be worse' and every time i'm wrong".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"i was in my 40s when i learned that congo wasn’t a belgian colony. The belgian government didn’t want to get into colonialism, so king leopold took it himself, as just a rich guy who could pay mercenaries. The man did private colonialism.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"it's been almost 20 years, but i remember it being "here's why belgian colonialism was good!" hard to find a more rapaciously plundered and systematically abused/neglected place under colonial rule in the 20th century. Maybe namibia.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the fucking belgians were so awful they got a telling off from all the the other fucking europeans for giving colonialism a bad name.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"i can't wait for the belgian congo part of this 19thc great power colonialism reboot to occur".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"it should be obvious that you've gone too far when fucking france goes "your colonialism is abhorrent"".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"i will admit as a smart alec student i didnt understand why colonialism was bad no one ever explained it or taught it. I saw it in terms of stability and development. Then i read about the belgian congo and everything made sense. Also launched me on a rabbit hole of colonial violence research.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"i had a no-shit belgian congo truther follow me this weekend. Colonialism wasn’t so bad! belgium civilized the region! good lord.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"i'd say that the people of belgian congo got the same benefit of colonialism as the ceo of uhc got from his sudden bloodletting.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"news: let's look at haiti and their gang violence problem me: caused by french colonialism partner: *tisks and nudges me* its history babes! read a documentary!".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"late 19th century colonialism was no less harsh than in 1600s. Germany still coming to terms with namibia, french still ignore what they did in 'indochina'. And the 'belgian congo', . Well, all one has to do is look at the ongoing aftermath of leopold ii of belgium in the drc.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the horrors committed against the people of the congo by belgium exceeds the crimes of the holocaust by two times over. Court ruling on belgium’s conduct in colonial africa hailed as turning point every european colonial nation must have a colonialism museum.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"this is horrifically bad. If you don’t know the history of the congo, it is ground zero of among the worst crimes against humanity that colonialism ever produced.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"for reasons i’m not 100% clear on, i’ve been followed by a belgian congo colonialism apologist account. Apparently 19th century colonialism had “humanitarian” aims and wanted to “lift” the civilisational level of indigenous peoples:".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the belgian-congolese colonial past represented in belgian history textbooks from 1945? pr. Karel van nieuwenhuyse (ku leuven - faculteit letteren) retraces the long road from triumphalism to postcolonial critical analysis.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the people didn't stop speaking french because they feared european colonialism. They did it because europe stood by and let slaughter happen.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"belgians pitting the tutsis against the hutus wasn’t some historical aberration but the standard operating procedure of european colonialism, downstream consequences be damned.".</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">"the dreadful long tail of colonialism.
