<h1>12. El Debate sobre Sexismo y Racismo en la Izquierda</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. Reconocimiento de un Problema Interno.</h2><p class="descripcion">Múltiples voces dentro del espectro de la izquierda reconocen que el sexismo y el racismo no son exclusivos de la derecha, sino que están profundamente arraigados y a menudo no se abordan en sus propios espacios.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I genuinely believe one of the major issues facing the left is how they are completely anti sexism/racism unless it's against white people or men, in which case it's borderline celebrated.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Absolutely. Plus racism &amp; sexism is as deeply embedded on the left as it is on the right.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The left also has an unspoken problem with ableism, racism, and sexism. I've been around politics since the late '70s and it's one reason why i don't call myself left, even though that's where my sympathies lie.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The left is riddled with sexism, it often centres male needs and excuses misogynist violence. I want as little part of that as i do old fashioned sexism of right wing.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Racism and sexism have been part of “the left” since marx and the other ogs. By playing “no true scotsman” bullshit games you’re part of the problem.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The amount of people who seem to don't think racism or sexism exists in leftist spaces geniunely alarms me bc as a poc i see it everywhere and it's impossible to escape.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sexism and left wing politics fit like a glove. . Wrote a whole article about this.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. Comparativas y Contrastes con la Derecha.</h2><p class="descripcion">Las publicaciones a menudo comparan el sexismo y el racismo de la izquierda con el de la derecha, señalando que mientras la derecha lo promueve abiertamente, en la izquierda se manifiesta de formas más sutiles, hipócritas o no examinadas.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Least they acknowledge that conservative ideals are racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">And plenty of open, loud sexism as well. The right wing loves that and promotes it, like they do racism, xenophobia, and anti-lgbt bigotry. Hate unifies their tribe.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">This leaning into the sexism becomes a common ground between the right and the left and it’s a big reason for my despair.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sexism against women is a problem on the right, sexism against men is a problem on the left. Racism is a problem on the right.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Yeah this is why there's a huge problem of sexism, sexual predation and sexual assault on the left. At least men on the right don't pretend they see women as people only to mock them for pointing out men's shortcomings.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Most sexism from the left is usually unaware and not malicious or random exceptions.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sexism, misogyny, and racism are just as rife on the far left as they are the far right. There’s a reason they’re so white-centric &amp; non-white voters generally avoid them.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. El Rol de los Hombres Blancos y el Reduccionismo de Clase.</h2><p class="descripcion">Se identifica a un sector de hombres blancos de izquierda como un foco del problema, quienes a menudo minimizan el sexismo y el racismo como distracciones de la "lucha de clases", sin examinar sus propios prejuicios.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Thank you. My specific issue is with leftist men who clearly haven’t examined how much sexism they still carry and express .</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">And a lot of the sexism and racism is embodied in white leftie dude bros, as i know you know.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">There's a certain kind of progressive (ranging from center-left to far left) that refuses to see racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry as anything other than distractions from the class war. Perhaps unsurprisingly they're largely white males.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Yeah, white male leftists being uninterested in addressing racism or sexism has an unfortunately long history.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Let’s not forget the most common factor in politics which frankly many male leftists of more…privileged backgrounds are often guilty of: sexism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It's really striking how leftist men simply cannot/refuse to acknowledge systemic sexism and millennia of cultural, political, ideological misogyny.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Because their version of leftism includes non white communities being more upset about class than race bc they don’t want to engage their own privileges. Only a white male could question the sexism and racism.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. Consecuencias y Conflictos en el Movimiento.</h2><p class="descripcion">El sexismo y el racismo internos generan desconfianza, alejan a aliados valiosos (especialmente mujeres) y se convierten en una debilidad estratégica que la derecha explota, debilitando la cohesión y los objetivos del movimiento.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I've met liberal women whose main point of alienation from the left is the misogyny, the "dirtbag bernie bros" who refuse to evaluate their complicity in sexism or center patriarchy as a formidable axis of oppression, while expecting women to organize with them on class issues.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It literally gives them ammo when you do sexism bc then they just say "wow the left are the true sexists" and they look correct.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Failure to recognize racism and sexism as fascist in structure is a massive and widespread failing of the far left. Its also why bernie of the three houses fails to win primaries- racism is the core ingredient of the inequality pie in the us.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">This also plays directly into the misogyny of the right, helping the maga assholes trash any left leaning policy due to rampant sexism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The uncomfortable reality is that men on the left hate women almost as much as men on the right. And like women on the right, too many women on the left would rather go along with sexism and seem cool than object and be deemed an uptight bitch.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I have long chosen to put my political energy into women because i have seen how the male dominated left treats women, i have known many left wing men to abuse women.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">What op described was women being driven away from the left by sexism. Not women being driven away by podcasters using pronouns.</span></li></ul></div></div>
