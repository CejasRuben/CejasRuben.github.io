<h1>6. Las profundas raíces de la misoginia en las elecciones presidenciales de Estados Unidos</h1>
</div>
<div class="contenido-principal"><div class="seccion"><h2>1. Misogyny as a Decisive Factor in Elections.</h2><p class="descripcion">Many contributors assert that misogyny is a pervasive and active force in American politics, directly leading to the defeat of qualified female candidates in presidential elections.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny is alive and well in america. Both times a qualified woman ran against this shithead they lost. Unbelievable.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Well, the current us misogyny is enormous.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny is why she didn't win.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny has cost us two elections from women who over qualify that orange pos by a landslide.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny reigned again… a bunch of folks would rather have the least competent, most corrupt man to ever run for president &amp; an adjudicated rapist than any independent woman regardless of qualifications.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2. Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris: Case Studies.</h2><p class="descripcion">The experiences of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Kamala Harris in 2024 are frequently cited as prime examples of misogyny in action, despite their qualifications.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Hillary lost and she was white and eminently qualified.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sadly. Nope. None of this. It was misogyny . After checking 2012, 16, 20 &amp; 24 i realized it. I always thought, hillary lost because she's unlikable . Nope. Sadly not. Americans are still not able to elect a woman, and kamala was perfect. And now the proof . Then it's obvious.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny and misogynoir are definitely part of why trump won (again).</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny at its finest. And we wonder why kamala didn't win.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Both times trump won an election he was running against a female opponent. I am convinced that for millions of americans, misogyny played a part in their poor choice.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>3. Misogyny vs. Racism.</h2><p class="descripcion">A recurring theme is the comparison between the impact of misogyny and racism, with many suggesting that misogyny is an equally, if not more, potent barrier to female leadership in the US.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I'm pretty sure that misogyny is stronger in this country than racism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The misogyny is just as bad as the racism, maybe worse.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny runs even deeper than racism. Double whammy for kamala.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Our misogyny exceeds our racism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Racism and misogyny are everywhere in america. Kamala lost the vote because she was black and female.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>4. The "America Isn't Ready" Sentiment.</h2><p class="descripcion">Many express a pessimistic view that the United States is not yet prepared to elect a woman as president, citing deep-seated cultural issues.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I don't think america can get over its "mommy issues" enough to elect a woman leader.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It's true the us "isn't ready for a woman president," just like they're not ready to move left.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The misogyny in america runs too deep. We’re not ready to elect a woman president yet.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It's been proven at least twice now that americans will not vote for a woman to be president. Misogyny is a huge problem.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">There is no way this america will elect a woman.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>5. Internalized Misogyny and Voter Behavior.</h2><p class="descripcion">The discussion extends to how internalized misogyny, even among women, contributes to the reluctance to vote for female candidates.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sadly misogyny is universal. Voting for an intelligent black woman was a bridge too far for some.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Men and women with internalized misogyny are why she didn't win.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Polls show men across all classes would not vote for her. I think misogyny had a lot to do with her loss.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">The saddest part is women didn’t vote for her either.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">53% of white women voted for trump. You can pretend misogyny is only in men but you are wrong. Women can't even get women to vote for women.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>6. Counterarguments and Alternative Explanations.</h2><p class="descripcion">While many attribute losses to misogyny, some voices in the discussion offer alternative reasons, such as flawed campaigns, unlikability, or specific policy stances.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Not misogyny just raw politics. This country won’t elect her mainly because progressives do not win elections.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Not saying misogyny isn’t a problem in the us but do you have evidence to support the claim that this was the reason she lost?</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I do not believe at all that was the sole or even strongest reason, though. Both ran losing, uncompelling campaigns. Stop blaming their womanhood for failing.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">It wasn't misogyny everyone just hated her. Literally all dems had to do to win that one was run literally anyone but her.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Misogyny isn't why kamala lost. Her zionism is. She was supposed to break from biden's zionism and didnt. Nobody showed up. Nothing to do with her being a woman. Smh.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>7. Future Outlook for Female Candidates.</h2><p class="descripcion">Given the perceived impact of misogyny, there is debate about the strategic wisdom of nominating female candidates in upcoming elections, with some advocating for a male candidate to ensure a win.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">So let’s deliberately pick a candidate that millions of voters will not even consider voting for? i’m sorry, but winning elections is more important than breaking glass ceilings.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I hate that i have to say this. I hate it with every fiber of my being. But i don't think a woman can win in the current climate of this country.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">I would love to see it, but honestly, i don’t want to take any chances with a woman on the ballot in 2028. Misogyny is rampant in this country and is much more pervasive than racism when it comes to women in power.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Sadly there’s too much misogyny n this country to elect a woman to the presidency any time soon.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">If we run a woman, we will lose again, and we will deserve it. There is too much misogyny. Too much poison.</span></li></ul></div></div>
