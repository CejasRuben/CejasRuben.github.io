Acusaciones de Neo-Colonialismo y Aspiraciones Imperialistas.</h2><p class="descripcion">Se argumenta que las acciones y declaraciones de Trump reflejan una mentalidad colonialista, buscando expandir la influencia y el control de Estados Unidos sobre otros países.</p><ul class="lista-citas"><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Western imperialism and colonialism are alive and well with trump as us president.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump is doing a colonialism: from the pillage of public goods, to the claims of birthright superiority over the rest of us...to threatened annexation of sovereign lands (greenland, canada, panama), to the old school penal colonies!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump wants to make imperialism and colonialism great again like the fascist he is.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Maga or american colonialism? since trump was elected, he advocated absorbing canada, invading mexico, taking back the panama canal, which we had leased, and buying greenland.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump wanting to “take” the panama canal, greenland and canada is at once appalling but also yeah, colonialism and its toxic entitlement never went away, it was barely hiding….</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump: “the united states will consider itself a growing country [by] expanding its territory.” “we will take back the panama canal.” wow. Colonialism is back, folks. Actual, de facto colonialism!</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump's foreign policy brings the worst aspects of colonialism and economic imperialism back: always siding with the current more powerful side in conflicts, no matter the ethics, for convenience. Callous greed and supremacy delusions abound.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump’s trade “policy” is mercantilism and colonialism. Sort-of-worked once, not likely to do so now.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump is in part responding to a broadly felt crisis in us neocolonialism due to the sense that chinese capital and “soft power” are becoming too competitive in strategically important parts of the world. His solution is to revert to old school colonialism.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Colonialism lives in the hearts and minds of the republican party and trump administration.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump represents the continuation of white settler colonialism and the idea that white people should rule over everyone else.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Trump is the logical product of a system based on colonialism and white supremacy.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Shh, we're supposed to pretend the colonialism isn't happening as long as the colonialists are slapping trump around.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Americans should be up in arms about trumps aspiring colonialism.instead we have this vile garbage.</span></li><li class="cita-item"><span class="cita-original">Seeing a us president promoting colonialism in 2025 is pretty surreal. Whether it happens or not is another issue. But merely advocating such things in a direct way is deeply out of touch with history. Anybody who’s ever read about colonial rule knows how appalling &amp; undemocratic it is.</span></li></ul></div><div class="seccion"><h2>2.
